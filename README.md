# Duplicate-Files

Powershell.exe to compare the filenames from 2 different directories and their subfolders. This will highlight files of the same name, irrespective of their file extension.

Please do not try and compare a subfolder already contained within your other folder selection. This was the only error correction I was unable to get working successfully at the moment.
This will obviously find false positives as it will be comparing files with themselves.

I use this program to compare files in my 720p, 1080p and Other folders, to search for duplicates of the same movie where I have replaced them with a better quality version.

Requires Powershell V4. If not already installed, please find your correct download here..... https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/21016.how-to-install-windows-powershell-4-0.aspx

If you download and find this file useful, please let me know, as any feedback would be most welcome.
